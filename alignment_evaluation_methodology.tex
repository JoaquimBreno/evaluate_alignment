\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Precise temporal alignment between audio recordings and their corresponding MIDI representations is fundamental for various applications in musical signal processing, including automatic music transcription (AMT), performance-based synthesis, and computational musicological analysis. Evaluating the quality of this alignment requires robust metrics that capture both temporal and spectral aspects of correspondence between modalities.

Traditionally, alignment methods rely on representations such as chroma features or Constant-Q Transform (CQT), using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms to find optimal temporal correspondences. However, evaluating the quality of these alignments remains challenging, especially when considering the expressive variability inherent in musical performances and the complexity of polyphonic music.

This work proposes an evaluation pipeline that transforms both audio and MIDI into fundamental frequency (F0) contours, enabling direct comparison in the frequency domain. A key innovation is the use of RMVPE (Robust Model for Vocal Pitch Estimation in Polyphonic Music) for audio F0 extraction, which overcomes traditional limitations in polyphonic music processing. The timed edit distance metric is then applied to quantify temporal and spectral deviations, providing an objective measure of alignment quality that is robust to musical complexity.

\section{Theoretical Foundation}
\label{sec:fundamentacao}

\subsection{F0 Contour Extraction}

The fundamental frequency (F0) represents the lowest harmonic component in a musical signal, corresponding to pitch perception. Precise extraction of F0 contours is crucial for temporal alignment analysis.

\subsubsection{Audio F0 Extraction}

For audio signals, we employ RMVPE (Robust Model for Vocal Pitch Estimation in Polyphonic Music), a state-of-the-art model specifically designed to extract vocal pitch from polyphonic music without requiring source separation preprocessing. Unlike traditional methods that struggle with accompaniment interference, RMVPE directly processes polyphonic audio to extract robust F0 contours.

The RMVPE model addresses key limitations of previous approaches:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct polyphonic processing}: No need for music source separation
    \item \textbf{Robust feature extraction}: Effective hidden feature learning from complex audio
    \item \textbf{Noise resilience}: Maintains performance across various SNR levels
    \item \textbf{High accuracy}: Superior raw pitch accuracy (RPA) and raw chroma accuracy (RCA)
\end{itemize}

The model operates with the following configuration:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sample rate: 22.05 kHz (standard audio processing rate)
    \item Hop size: 320 samples (~14.5ms)
    \item F0 range: 50-2000 Hz (extended range for comprehensive pitch detection)
    \item Model architecture: Deep neural network with attention mechanisms
    \item Output resolution: Frame-level F0 predictions with confidence scores
\end{itemize}

The extraction process can be formalized as:

\begin{equation}
F0_{audio}(t) = \text{RMVPE}(x(t), \theta_{rmvpe})
\end{equation}

where $x(t)$ is the polyphonic audio signal and $\theta_{rmvpe}$ represents the pre-trained RMVPE model parameters. The model outputs both F0 values and confidence scores, enabling quality-aware alignment evaluation.

\subsubsection{MIDI F0 Extraction}

For MIDI files, we implement three F0 extraction strategies:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Melody Method}: Extracts the melodic line prioritizing notes in the middle register (MIDI 50-95) with higher velocity
    \item \textbf{Bass Method}: Always selects the lowest active note
    \item \textbf{Lowest Method}: Invariably uses the note with the lowest pitch
\end{enumerate}

The MIDI F0 extraction algorithm is described in Algorithm \ref{alg:midi_f0}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{MIDI F0 Extraction}
\label{alg:midi_f0}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE MIDI file $M$, method $m \in \{\text{melody, bass, lowest}\}$
\ENSURE F0 contour $F0_{midi}(t)$
\STATE Load MIDI data: $M = \text{PrettyMIDI}(file)$
\STATE Create time grid: $T = [0, \Delta t, 2\Delta t, ..., T_{end}]$
\STATE Initialize: $F0_{midi} = \mathbf{0}_{|T|}$
\FOR{$t \in T$}
    \STATE $N_{active} = \{n : n.start \leq t < n.end\}$
    \IF{$N_{active} \neq \emptyset$}
        \IF{$m = \text{melody}$}
            \STATE $N_{mel} = \{n \in N_{active} : 50 \leq n.pitch \leq 95\}$
            \IF{$N_{mel} \neq \emptyset$}
                \STATE $n^* = \arg\max_{n \in N_{mel}} (0.7 \cdot n.pitch + 0.3 \cdot n.velocity)$
            \ELSE
                \STATE $n^* = \arg\max_{n \in N_{active}} n.pitch$
            \ENDIF
        \ELSIF{$m = \text{bass}$ OR $m = \text{lowest}$}
            \STATE $n^* = \arg\min_{n \in N_{active}} n.pitch$
        \ENDIF
        \STATE $F0_{midi}(t) = 440 \cdot 2^{(n^*.pitch - 69)/12}$
    \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Temporal Alignment via DTW}

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is used to find optimal temporal alignment between chroma representations derived from audio and MIDI. The process involves:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conversion to chroma representation (12 dimensions)
    \item Feature normalization
    \item Cost matrix calculation using cosine distance
    \item FastDTW algorithm application
\end{enumerate}

The cost matrix is defined as:

\begin{equation}
C(i,j) = 1 - \frac{\mathbf{c}_{midi}(i) \cdot \mathbf{c}_{audio}(j)}{||\mathbf{c}_{midi}(i)|| \cdot ||\mathbf{c}_{audio}(j)||}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{c}_{midi}(i)$ and $\mathbf{c}_{audio}(j)$ are the normalized chroma vectors.

\section{Evaluation Methodology}
\label{sec:metodologia}

\subsection{Evaluation Pipeline}

The proposed evaluation pipeline consists of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Preprocessing}: Loading and initial synchronization of MIDI and audio files
    \item \textbf{Feature Extraction}: Generation of F0 contours for both modalities
    \item \textbf{Temporal Alignment}: DTW application for synchronization
    \item \textbf{Metrics Calculation}: Quantification of alignment quality
    \item \textbf{Statistical Analysis}: Aggregated evaluation of results
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

\subsubsection{Timed Edit Distance}

The Timed Edit Distance (TED) is adapted for F0 contours, considering both temporal and spectral deviations:

\begin{equation}
TED(F0_1, F0_2) = \min_{\pi} \sum_{i=1}^{|\pi|} w(\pi_i)
\end{equation}

where $\pi$ represents an alignment between sequences and $w(\pi_i)$ is the cost of alignment operation $\pi_i$.

Operation costs are defined as:

\begin{align}
w_{match}(f_1, f_2, \Delta t) &= \alpha \cdot |f_1 - f_2| + \beta \cdot |\Delta t| \\
w_{insert}(f) &= \gamma \\
w_{delete}(f) &= \gamma
\end{align}

where $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are weights that balance the importance of spectral deviations, temporal deviations, and insertion/deletion operations.

\subsubsection{Complementary Metrics}

In addition to TED, we use complementary metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mean Temporal Error (MTE)}: $MTE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |t_{midi}(i) - t_{audio}(\pi(i))|$
    \item \textbf{Mean Spectral Error (MSE)}: $MSE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |F0_{midi}(i) - F0_{audio}(\pi(i))|$
    \item \textbf{Pearson Correlation}: $r = \frac{\text{cov}(F0_{midi}, F0_{audio})}{\sigma_{midi} \sigma_{audio}}$
\end{itemize}
